This is a companion repo for [How to set up and use feature flags in a Nuxt.js Application]('https://configcat.com')

## About this sample app

 Its' a fictitious movie app called **AcmeTV Shows** built with the **Nuxt.js** framework.

 Here is what it looks like:

 <!-- TODO: Add snap here -->

## How it works

The body of the app contains a **Trending Movies** and a **Movies** section.

In the companion article, I integrated feature flagging using [ConfigCat's](https://configcat.com/) feature flag services. This allowed me to show / hide the **Trending Movies** section by toggling its feature flag in my ConfigCat dashboard.
