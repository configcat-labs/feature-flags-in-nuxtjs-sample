This is a companion repo for [**How to set up and use Feature Flags in a Nuxt.js Application**](https://configcat.com/blog/2022/07/01/how-to-use-feature-flags-in-nuxtjs/)

## About this sample app

This app is a fictional movie app called **AcmeTV Shows** built with the Nuxt.js framework

 Here is what it looks like:

## How it works

The body of the app contains two sections:
1. **Trending Movies** section
2. **Movies** section

In the companion article, I integrated feature flagging using [ConfigCat's](https://configcat.com/) feature flag services. This allowed me to show / hide the **Trending Movies** section by toggling its feature flag in my ConfigCat dashboard.

## How to run the App

1. Clone this code repository

2. Open a terminal in the root of this repo

3. Install the required npm packages by running:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the app locally by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```
